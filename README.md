# DATS Perspectives
This repo contains the evaluation experiments of the paper "DATS Perspectives â€“ Interactive Document Clustering in the Discourse Analysis Tool Suite"

Have a look at the DATS repo here: https://github.com/uhh-lt/dats

## Goals

In the paper, we introduce changes to the typcial topic discovery pipeline in order to develop a more customizable aspect-focused document clustering pipeline:
1. optional document rewriting with an LLM
2. document embedding with instruction fine-tuned embedding model
3. dimensionality reduction with UMAP
4. clustering with HDBSCAN

This enables users to define two kinds of prompts to steer the document clustering:
- document rewriting prompts (e.g. summarize the main topic of this document)
- embedding instruction prompts (e.g. identify the main topic)

Further, we allow few-shot embeding model fine-tuning in order to align the clustering even more with user intent.
In this repo, we evaluate 2, 4, 8, and 16-shot few-shot learning.

## Evaluation

We evaluate this pipeline on three datasets:
- Spotify Songtexts
- Amazon Reviews
- 20 Newsgroups posts

We compute the following metrics, but only report knn accuracy in the paper:
- silhouette score
- adjusted rand index
- v measure score
- purity
- knn accuracy

## Results

These are the same results that we report in the paper:
